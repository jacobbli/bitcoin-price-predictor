# Bitcoin Price Predictor 

## Description

This is our final project for our business analytics course (BUS 462) at Simon Fraser University. 

Group members:
- Ajay Kaila
- Maheen Khan
- Jacob Lee
- Ammaar Muzammil
- Toby Oktavian Sutrisno

## Purpose
Our goal is to predict whether the price of Bitcoin will increase the next day. To achieve this, we train multiple SVM and decision tree classifiers using different subsets of attributes. The model with the highest precision score will be used in our web application to make daily predictions for our "clients".

## Datasets
- [Bitcoin historical daily prices from April 29, 2013 to December 12, 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/mtakcy/historical-data-for-top-20-coins-by-market-cap?sele)
- Sentiment scores for each post on the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit from January 1, 2017 to February 17, 2018

## Tools

- Python for data preparation
- KNIME for training and evaluating the models
